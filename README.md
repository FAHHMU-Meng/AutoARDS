## üìñ Introduction

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains a major concern in intensive care units (ICUs), with mortality rates exceeding **40%**. Although chest CT is routinely performed in ARDS evaluation, its role has traditionally been **qualitative and subjective**.

We present **AutoARDS**, the first **CT-based foundation model** that transforms chest CT into a **quantitative tool** for ARDS evaluation and management. AutoARDS integrates lesion segmentation, multimodal representation learning, and prognosis modeling into a single framework.

### üîë Key Contributions
1. **Self-supervised lesion segmentation**  
   - Dice score: **75.62%**  
   - Establishes the first reproducible CT-derived quantitative biomarker for ARDS burden and progression tracking (>85% accuracy).

2. **Stepwise diagnosis**  
   - Acute respiratory failure (ARF): **AUC 0.9692‚Äì0.9805**  
   - ARDS within ARF patients: **AUC 0.8498‚Äì0.9249**, surpassing human diagnostic performance.

3. **Quantitative physiology from CT**  
   - Direct estimation of P/F ratio (Pearson r: **0.793‚Äì0.878**)  
   - Enables Berlin-definition severity stratification with **72‚Äì75% accuracy**.  
   - Outperforms conventional SpO‚ÇÇ-based surrogates.

4. **Extended clinical endpoints**  
   - ARDS-associated right ventricular dysfunction (RVD) estimation: **AUC 0.6715‚Äì0.8564**  
   - Longitudinal 28-day survival prediction: **time-averaged AUC 0.7872**

5. **Biological aging analysis**  
   - ARDS patients show an accelerated pulmonary aging shift (**Œî = +6.044**).

By consolidating multiple diagnostic procedures into a **single CT-driven workflow**, AutoARDS provides a scalable paradigm for **quantitative medical imaging**.
